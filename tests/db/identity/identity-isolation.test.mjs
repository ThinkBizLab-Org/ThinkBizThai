// What can be proven about the batch 010 isolation suite WITHOUT a database.
//
// Owner: A1 Identity. Run with:  LC_ALL=C TZ=UTC node --test tests/db/identity/
//
// This file does not prove tenant isolation and does not claim to. Isolation is proven by
// run-isolation.mjs against a live database, and no database is wired — RFC-2026-017 §7 and
// WP-0A-DB-00's open blockers both say so, and nothing here changes it.
//
// What it does prove is that the INSTRUMENT is honest, which is the failure mode this repository
// keeps finding: a suite whose assertions are shaped so that they would pass on a database with
// no policies at all. Three properties are checked, and each is checked because getting it wrong
// produces a green run that means nothing:
//
//   * every id comes from the fixture catalog and none is generated;
//   * no mutation is asserted with a read assertion, and every filtered write carries a witness;
//   * the migration's grants make the service denial attributable to RLS rather than to a
//     forgotten GRANT.
//
// And the last test runs the whole case list through a fake database where RLS does nothing, and
// requires the suite to FAIL. A suite that has never been observed failing is not evidence.
