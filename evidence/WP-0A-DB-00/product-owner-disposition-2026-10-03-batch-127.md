# Product Owner disposition, 2026-10-03: #165's merge, and batch 127's four points

**Package:** `WP-0A-DB-00`.

This file is A0's (`/claude/a0_atlas`) transcription of the Owner's words in session, not the Owner's
own text. It records what the words answered, as A0 read them, and what is still open. It approves no
merge and grants no role's signature.

## 1. The Owner's words, verbatim

| Date | Words |
|---|---|
| 2026-10-03 | `คุณลุยตามที่แนะนำได้เลย` |

A0's gloss: "go ahead as you recommend". The words reached the run that wrote this file through A0's
workflow, which relayed them verbatim with A0's reading below. That run did not see the session
itself.

## 2. What A0 had asked, and A0's reading of the answer

The words replied to one message from A0 that put four points. A0 read them as answering **all four,
as A0 recommended**:

| # | A0's message | A0's recommendation | A0's reading of the answer |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | #165 (batch 126) was ready: its role runs and re-checks had found nothing blocking, its required check was green; A0 asked for the Owner's words to merge it. | Merge #165. | Merge #165. |
| 2 | May 127's migration number sit in MOD-120's reserved range 115-129, as 126's does (O1 on 126 answered that for 126 only)? | Yes, keep 127: it must sort after 120 (`app.publish_intents`, the newest table it touches) and after 126. | Keep 127. |
| 3 | The draft's D1 showed that a looser permissive INSERT sibling on 17 of the 19 created_by tables is held only by the runtime closure; only 081's and 091's replacements pin a permissive count. | Pin the PERMISSIVE policy set of every client-writable table in this batch. | Do it in batch 127. |
| 4 | Remedy (b) of 105's note: move created_by out of the client INSERT grant and let the database set it. | Do NOT do it now: it changes the grant contract on 19 tables, and the restrictive closure already binds the column. | Do not take remedy (b) now. |

A0 transcribes; the Owner decided. Where this reading is wrong, the Owner's correction replaces it.

## 3. The merge of #165

**What A0 did.** On those words A0 merged PR #165
(<https://github.com/ThinkBizLab-Org/ThinkBizThai/pull/165>) at its reviewed head
`84df4d4dba5afc1b144cfb562de8a655bb01a774`, with its required check green on that head (run
37111859581, "Bootstrap validation", success). The merge commit is
`3f80599269186895fd4e6de368c837b7be48f9e8`, at 2026-10-03T10:08:51Z.

**A0 EXECUTED the Owner's decision; A0 did not make it.** The standing answer `ใช่ merge ทำต่อได้เลย`
(product-owner-disposition-2026-10-03-batch-126.md §2) lets A0 press a merge the Owner has decided;
the words above are that decision for #165.

**The RFC-2026-025 §5 points remain open.** The blocker beginning "RFC-2026-025 §5, WHAT IT LEAVES
OPEN, FOR THE OWNER" is unchanged by these words, which were about this merge and this batch, not the
RFC's text. RFC-2026-002's rule as CONTRIBUTING_AGENTS.md states it ("Before the Product Owner
merges, …") is still not met literally when A0 presses the button, and this file does not claim it is.

## 4. Batch 127, written on these answers

Branch `agent/claude/WP-0A-DB-00-batch-127`, from `3f80599`; plan `a0-batch-127-plan-2026-10-03.md`.

- Point 2: the migration is `127_created_by_on_insert_is_caller.sql`, in 115-129.
- Point 3: the permissive policy probe pins the 74 permissive policies on the 25 client-writable app
  tables by name, command, roles and exact deparse. Measured: the draft's D1 now fails migrate-clean
  by name on all 19 created_by tables (plan §4).
- Point 4: created_by stays in the client INSERT grant, bound by `<table>_created_by_is_caller`.

## 5. What this file does not do

It does not mark batch 127 ready, approve it, or merge it. Its role runs (C0, Q0, A1) follow, and the
PR stays a Draft until they report and the Owner decides its merge.

Still open after these words: the RFC-2026-025 §5 points (above); and, recorded on blocker 186, the
client-encoding change through a run-time-computed name and schema `public` (A1 F6 on 123).
